## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Aeshwa-Kachhadiya/Multimodal-skin-disease-analysis.git
cd Multimodal-skin-disease-analysis

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up API key (get free key from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env

# Run application
streamlit run app.py
```

### Usage

1. **Text Analysis**: Describe symptoms
   ```

## 🎨 Demo

```python
# Example interaction
User: "Dark mole with irregular borders, been growing"

AI Response:
🔍 Analysis: Melanoma (Critical)
Severity: Critical - Melanoma
Matched symptoms: irregular, changing, dark brown

Treatment Options:
1. URGENT: Surgical excision with wide margins
2. Sentinel lymph node biopsy
3. Immunotherapy (pembrolizumab, nivolumab)

⚠️ URGENT: Consult a dermatologist immediately!
